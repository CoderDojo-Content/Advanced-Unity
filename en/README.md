1. These Sushi Cards will allow you to create a 2D platformer game. If you have done the **Scratch Sushi Cards**, it might remind you of that. At the end you can try to code your own powerups!

2. You will learn how to create an *animation*, what *Object Oriented Programming* is, and more! 

3. This tutorial builds off the knowledge learned in the previous two Sushi Cards, so if you haven't done those, try them out now!

4. I provided some code for this so that you've already learned in previous tutorials! You can read through the comments in the code if you want to understand what it is doing!

5. Anywhere you need to add code look for a line comment that looks like this: `/*####################################################################*/`.  

6. You will build your game with WebGL, downloading it before you get to the dojo will save you time! To do this go to (**File > Build Settings**) and select **WebGL** from the **Platform** list. Now, click the **Open Download Page** button on the right of the **Platform** list.
