1. Now it's time to create a menu system for your game! You will create a main menu, a levels menu, and a button to get to the menu after the game is finished.

2. To create a main menu you will need a new scene. Create one and call it something you can remember like "mainmenu". 

3. Now that you have a new scene, you can start creating the menu. In the **Inspector** go (**Create > UI > Button**). Do this twice so you have two buttons and move them into a place that you like. Change the *Text* object under the buttons in the hierarchy to "Play!" and "levels".

4. Now you can give your game a name or add images to it. This will make it your own game! Here's what mine looks like:
![](/assets/mainmenu.png)

5. You can use the "levelsmenu" scene that I already created, but feel free to change it up so it looks how you want it to! 

6. Switch to the "mainmenu" scene. You will make the buttons work now! To do this, create a new C# script . Replace `Start()` and `Update()` with
    
    ```csharp
    public void nextScene(string scene)
    {
        SceneManager.LoadScene(scene);
    }
    ```
    
    and save it.
    
7. Now create an empty object and name it "buttonController". Attach the script you just created to it.

8. Go to the **Inspector** for your "play" button and find the "Button (Script)" property. Drag the "buttonController" object from the **Hierarchy** to the bottom left box in the **On Click ()** property. Where it says **No Function**, click the drop down and select the script you created earlier, then select *nextScene(string)*. Finally, write the name of the scene you want to switch to in the bottom right box. It should look like this if youve done it correctly:

    ![](/assets/onclick.png)
    
9. You can do the same process as step 8 to the "levels" button, but all you need to do is change the scene name in the bottom right box to "levelsmenu" and the button will switch to that scene instead.

10. Run the main menu scene and test out the buttons. You should switch into the different scenes. 

11. Repeat this step for levels menu scene. 

12. The levels that I gave you will have a button that pops up at the end of a game and bring you back to levels menu scene. If you make new levels all you need to do is add buttons to the scene, main menu scene, and the levels menu scene.
