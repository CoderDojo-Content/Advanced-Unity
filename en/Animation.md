1. *Animation* is using multiple images and playing them in a sequence. Unity has a built in **Animator** that allows you to easily create your own *animations*. 

2. Creating your own *animations* is easy in Unity! To create an **Animator** all you need to do is Shift Click all ten of the Idle images and drag them all into the inspector. You will have to save the *animation*, give it a name like "idle". 

    Now hit play and watch your new animation!
